# Cabauw test case with (LS)2D input
Simple Cabauw test case for the land-surface model and/or radiation.

The included (LS)2D input (`ls2d_20160815.nc`) is for the 15th of August 2016 (06:00 to 18:00 UTC).

Running the case requires:
- `microhh_tools.py` from the `microhh_root/python` directory.

The RRTMGP coefficient files are automatically linked from the `rte-rrtmgp-cpp` git submodule (`microhh_root/rte-rrtmgp-cpp`).
